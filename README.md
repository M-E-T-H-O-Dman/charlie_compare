Contribution to back-end of Makers Academy final project

Module containing two methods designed to calculate the distance between two sets
of GPS coordinates using the Haversine formula, which calculates the length of the
hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, while taking into account the curvature of
the Earth. Neat, huh!
