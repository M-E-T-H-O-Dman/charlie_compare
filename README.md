Contribution to back-end of Makers Academy final project

--------------------------------------------------------

Module containing two methods designed to calculate the distance between two sets\n
of GPS coordinates using the Haversine formula, which calculates the length of the\n
hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, while taking into account the curvature of\n
the Earth. Neat, huh!
